[![Frontend Masters](https://static.frontendmasters.com/assets/brand/logos/full.png)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-nextjs-state/)

In this course, we'll build and evolve a production-ready React application with scalable state management patterns. We'll start with the basics and progressively tackle more complex state challenges by implementing event-driven architecture, handling multiple sources of truth, and optimizing performance.

## Course Overview

You'll learn state management principles that can be applied to any application, regardless of framework, size, or complexity. This course combines theory with hands-on practice through a series of progressive exercises.

### Key Takeaways

By participating in this course, you'll learn to:

- **Architect state management solutions** that scale with application complexity
- **Avoid common React state management pitfalls** and anti-patterns
- **Model state using event-driven patterns** for more predictable applications
- **Balance local, shared, and server state** for optimal performance
- **Debug and troubleshoot complex state issues** efficiently

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and a package manager (pnpm, npm, or yarn) installed
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript

### Installation

```bash
# or npm install or yarn install
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# or npm run dev or yarn dev
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the course application.

### Testing

```bash
# or npm test or yarn test
pnpm test
```
